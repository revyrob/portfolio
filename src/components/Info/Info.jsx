    <p className='info__p'>At 18 years old, I moved to Lake Louise, Canada, to live in a ski town, despite never having skied before. At 19, I left for London, England on my own on a two-year working visa. During my 20s, I drove a snow groomer at three different BC resorts, worked as an environmental technician across BC and Alberta, learned how to bookkeep and complete payroll for different companies, renovated an old building with my husband, and started a bar. At 30, I celebrated my birthday - 6 months pregnant - at a 10-day silent meditation retreat. At 34, I moved to France with my family to learn French. At 35, I started to learn to code. I enjoy continuous learning, inner reflection, working with dynamic individuals, and living outside my comfort zone. I love programming because it requires me to constantly think analytically, transform ideas into tangible applications, and adapt to constant change.</p>
    <p className='info__p '>I live by the motto 'Be Kind', and I have participated in many committees, organizations, and co-ops to help attain community progression. I have volunteered with environmental groups and hosted bike swaps. I was an executive member, starting a climbing co-op, and volunteered at community gardens and local food initiative organizations. I tried to start a car co-op but was deterred by insurance costs! Currently, I am an executive member with the parent group at my children's school.</p>
